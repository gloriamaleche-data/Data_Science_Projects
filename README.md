# Data_Science_Projects

## About
This repo contains my data science projects, documenting the process from raw data to insights.
It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, and modeling on real or sample datasets.

The goal is to demonstrate my ability to analyze data and communicate findings in a clear, actionable way.

## What's to be found inside?
- `datasets/` - cleaned or sample datasets
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks documenting analysis, visualization, and modeling
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for prreprocessing, feature engineering, and automation
- `visuals/` - charts, plots, and diagrams generated during analysis
- `results/` - final outputs, tables, and summaries
- `action/` - translating data into real decisions

## Learning Goals
- Develop data wrangling and exploratory analysis skills
- Learn how to generate actionable insights from messy datasets
- Build reproducible workflows for future projects

## For You: How to use
- Browse notebooks to understand workflow
- Replicate analysis using provided datasets
- Adapt scripts for your own datasets or projects
- Let's collaborate!
